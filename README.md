## Usage

### `resize.sh`
This bash script takes in image/video files and creates a thumbnail from the original image. The two, original and thumbnail, are put into their respective directories. Then HTML is echoed to be put into the appropriate file, in this case `index.html`.

### Masonry
The grid item tiling is done through [Salvattore](https://salvattore.js.org/)
